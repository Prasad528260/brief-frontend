## 🧠 Overview

**BriefAI** is a web application that helps users quickly understand **busy WhatsApp group chats** using AI-powered summaries.

In modern communication, important discussions often happen in group chats. While these platforms enable collaboration, they also make it easy to miss critical information when messages accumulate quickly. BriefAI is designed to reduce this overload by highlighting **what truly matters**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Clear communication is essential for effective collaboration. However, in today’s digital world, communication often happens through **large group chats**, where conversations move rapidly and span multiple topics.

When users are offline for some time, they return to:
- Hundreds of unread messages  
- Interleaved discussions  
- Important decisions hidden among casual conversation  

Reading every message is time-consuming, and skimming often leads to missing key points. Existing solutions do not offer a way to:
- Summarize **only unread messages**
- Filter messages by a **specific time range**
- Clearly extract **decisions, mentions, and action items**

As a result, users struggle to regain context efficiently.

---

## ✅ Solution

**BriefAI** addresses this problem by providing a focused and practical summarization workflow.

Users can:
- 📤 Upload exported **WhatsApp chat files**
- ⏱️ Select a **time range** or **last-read timestamp**
- 🤖 Generate a concise AI-powered summary highlighting:
  - Key topics discussed
  - Decisions made
  - Important mentions
  - Action items and next steps

This enables users to catch up confidently without reading every message.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🎯 Time-aware and context-aware summarization  
- 🧠 Focus on relevance rather than message volume  
- 📌 Structured, easy-to-read summaries
